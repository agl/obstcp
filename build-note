***** NOTE *****

Due to the way that the build process works, some compiler errors
are expected as we try to build different platform specific code
to find one that works.

Just because you see errors, it doesn't mean that the build failed.
Additionally, libevent development headers are needed to build
some of the optional utilities, but the core works fine without.
